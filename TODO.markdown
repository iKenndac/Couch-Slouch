## Stuff To Do ##

* AppleScript bridge to allow remote control sources other than via CEC.

* Keybind inheritance - modifying the base keybinds will also change keybinds
  that haven't been changed in application-specific ones.

* Better use of CEC features (interacting with other devices on the bus).
